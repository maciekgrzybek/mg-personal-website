#<span>Hi, I’m Maciek</span><br/>  JS Developer from Leeds
My name is Maciek Grzybek. I'm from Bialystok, Poland, but currently, I live around Leeds, UK. I work as a Software Engineer  in Stars Group. I absolutely love writing clean and maintainable  code as well as learning new things, reading about Javascript  and new technologies in general. I’m a big fan of React and  Gatsby (this site is built with it!). Recently, I've started  writing my own articles to show the stuff I've learned during my  career. I’ve also got really hooked on open source (Hacktober fest t-shirt on it’s way). I’m one of the maintainers/contributors in tina cms, gatsby, rooks, react-hooks projects. 
<br/>
<br/>
In my free time, I have three passions: coding, Rick and Morty  and sushi (in my previous life, I	was a sushi chef for almost 6  years). Hit me up if you want to talk about React, Plumbus or  how to roll a perfect maki.

P.S. Why mushroom in my logo? My last name means literally  ‘little mushroom’🍄.
