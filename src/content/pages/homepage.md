#<span>Hi, I’m Maciek</span><br/>  JS Developer from Leeds
My name is Maciek Grzybek. I'm from Bialystok, Poland, but currently, I live around Leeds, UK. I work as a Software Engineer in Stars Group. I absolutely love writing clean and maintainable code as well as learning new things, reading about Javascript and new technologies in general. I’m a big fan of React and Gatsby (this site is built with it!). Recently, I've started writing my own articles to show the stuff I've learned during my career. I’ve also got really hooked on open source (Hacktober- fest t-shirt on it’s way). I’m one of the maintainers in rooks and	react-hooks projects. 
<br/>
<br/>
In my free time, I have three passions: coding, Rick and Morty and sushi (in my previous life, I	was a sushi chef for almost 6 years). Hit me up if you want to talk about React, Plumbus or how to roll a perfect maki.

P.S. Why mushroom in my logo? My last name means literally ‘little mushroom’.
